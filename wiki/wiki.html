						<h3>Economics</h3>
							<p class="wiki-wiki-wip"><b>Market Allocation Scheme</b> - I was first prompted to look into this when I was in the Senior Project II class and Robin Kemper, former ASCE president, brought up a scenario where two civil engineering firms in New Jersey were tired of competing for clients and decided to divide their territories where one would take clients from one section of the state and the other firm would take the other section. As it turns out, this is unethical and an unfair competition practice. I wasn't sure why, so I asked ChatGPT, and it brought up some good points:</p>
							<ol class="wiki-wiki-wip">
								<li>Violation of Antitrust Laws: By dividing their territories, the two civil engineering firms are engaging in market allocation, which violates antitrust laws. This unethical behavior is punishable by law and can lead to fines and legal action.</li>
								<li>Unfair Competition: Dividing territories creates a monopoly for each firm in their respective area, eliminating competition. This means that clients in each area will not have access to the best possible services or prices that would come with competitive bids.</li>
								<li>Lack of Transparency: Clients may not be aware of the territorial division and may assume that they have access to multiple firms, leading to a false sense of competition and choice.</li>
								<li>Limited Professional Development: The engineers working for the two firms may have limited opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge, since they are not exposed to diverse projects or different types of clients.</li>
								<li>Unfairness to Employees: The territorial division may result in a reduced workload and less work for some employees, leading to layoffs or reduced hours, and adversely affecting their livelihoods.</li>
								<li>Violation of Professional Standards: The territorial division may go against the professional standards of the civil engineering profession, which requires competition and fair bidding processes to ensure that the best interests of clients and the public are served.</li>
							</ol>
							<p class="wiki-wiki-wip">In summary, the territorial division of clients by the two civil engineering firms presents several ethical dilemmas related to competition, fairness, transparency, professional development, and compliance with professional standards.
